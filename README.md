## Technical Architecture

The system employs a multi-layered approach:

1. **Input Processing**: URL normalization and validation
2. **Feature Extraction**: 30+ engineered features including:
   - URL characteristics (length, special characters, subdomains)
   - Domain properties (age, registrar, geolocation)
   - Content analysis (HTML structure, JavaScript behavior)
   - Security indicators (SSL status, redirect chains)
3. **Model Ensemble**: Combines multiple ML algorithms for robust predictions
4. **Output Generation**: Structured results with confidence metrics
